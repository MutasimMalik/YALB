# YALB (Yet Another Load Balancer)
Load Balancer is one type of Reverse Proxy in a simpler sense. If we consider popular reverse proxies like Nginx, YARP (Yet Another Reverve Proxy) or Ocelot API Gateway; we can create custom Load Balancer using any of them.
As YARP is relatively new amonng them and has a fantastic support with .Net in terms of configuration, so I use YARP's built in Load Balancing mechanisms to create a custom Load Balancer named YALB, where the name itself gives
homage to the YARP.
